# Project Spark: Go-Based Creative Idea Generator

## Overview
Project Spark is a lightweight CLI tool that generates unexpected but plausible tech project ideas from any keyword in under one second. Built in pure Go with no external dependencies, it helps developers, entrepreneurs, and creators overcome brainstorming blocks with instant, actionable concept suggestions.

## Example Usage
```bash
$ projectspark --keyword=health
A blockchain-based patient record system with zero-knowledge proofs for privacy

$ projectspark --keyword=finance
A decentralized DeFi dashboard with real-time risk scoring using machine learning

$ projectspark
Usage: projectspark --keyword=<topic>
Example: projectspark --keyword=travel
```

## Features
- Generates unique, tech-focused project ideas from any keyword
- Runs locally with no internet or API dependencies
- Sub-second idea generation using randomized patterns
- Simple CLI interface with zero configuration
- Fully self-contained – no external files or databases

## Installation & Setup

### Prerequisites
- Go 1.16 or higher

### Build Instructions
```bash
# Initialize module
go mod init projectspark

# Build the binary
go build -o projectspark main.go

# Run directly (no installation needed)
go run main.go --keyword=travel
```

### File Structure
```
/usr/src/project/
├── main.go        # Core logic and CLI handler
└── go.mod         # Go module definition
```

## Usage
```bash
# Generate an idea for a given keyword
projectspark --keyword=education

# View help (run with no arguments)
projectspark
```

## Core Logic
The tool uses a pattern-based generator with three components:
1. **User keyword** (e.g., "health")
2. **Randomized tech stack/pattern** (e.g., "blockchain-based", "AI-powered")
3. **Application concept** (e.g., "patient record system")

These are combined using grammatically structured templates to produce coherent ideas.

### Functions
- `generateIdea(keyword string) string`: Combines the input keyword with random tech patterns and concepts
- `main()`: Parses CLI flags and handles program flow

## Development & Customization

### Built With
- Pure Go (standard library only)
- `flag` package for command-line argument parsing
- Hardcoded word banks in `main.go`

### Extensibility Points
```go
// STUB: Replace with API call to trend database in v2
// STUB: Add configuration file support in v2
// STUB: Implement idea history log in v2
```

To customize the output, modify the hardcoded arrays in `main.go` containing:
- Tech prefixes (AI-powered, blockchain-based, etc.)
- Application types (dashboard, platform, system, etc.)
- Enhancement clauses (with real-time analytics, using federated learning, etc.)

## Verification Checklist
- [x] CLI runs with `--keyword` and prints valid idea
- [x] No-arg execution shows usage help
- [x] Builds without external dependencies
- [x] Generates different output on each run

## Performance
- Build time: < 2 seconds
- Execution time: < 100ms per idea
- Memory usage: < 5MB

## Version Notes
**v1.0**: Local CLI tool with hardcoded word banks.  
**v2.0 planned**: API integration, configuration files, and enhanced patterns.
